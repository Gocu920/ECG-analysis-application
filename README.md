# ECG-analysis-application

A desktop application for analysing data from an ECG test. The application includes several computational modules such as preprocessing, signal filtering with different methods, QRS complexes detection, detection of characteristic points of the ECG signal, time and frequency analysis of heart rate variability, geometric analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis and QRS complexes classification. Members of the project team and their roles: 
Project manager: Ewa Czarnecka
Software architects: Mateusz Goc, Julia Grendus
GUI: Wiktoria Foryś
Visualisation: Palina Kivachuk
Input/output: Wojciech Damian, Bartłomiej Krawczyk
ECG_baseline: Michalina Kozak
R_Peaks: Julia Całus
WAVES: Julia Kolasa
HRV1: Natalia Cebula
HRV2: Magdalena Bator
HRV_DFA: Ewa Krężel
Heart_Class: Patryk Celebański

My task as software architect was to participate in the design process of the application architecture, design the communication between modules and the GUI, and implement the communication between the modules: Input/Output, ECG_Baseline, R_Peaks, HRV1. I was also responsible for ensuring application responsiveness.
